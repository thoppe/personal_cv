  \item \textbf{Set national vision for AI R\&D} for major White House initiatives including the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR), the National Secure Data Service (NSDS), the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) subcommittee AI and ML, and the OMB Memorandum (\href{https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf}{M-24-10}), ``Advancing Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management for Agency Use of Artificial Intelligence''
  \item \textbf{Built coalitions} across the Federal government by connecting State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial governments through many engagements via the White House \href{https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/11/13/readout-of-roundtable-with-state-local-tribal-and-territorial-leaders-on-tech-policy/}{Tech Policy Network}, including the National League of Cities, the American Public Human Services Association, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists

  \begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Led organizational change} across CDC by bringing generative AI to all staff, the first Federal agency to do so. Accomplished results by leading 15 pilots programs across the Centers, coordinating financial, human, and IT resources, cleaning the program through cybersecurity, legal, and labor concerns.

  \item \textbf{Modernized} NCHS data systems through cloud adoption through a multi-year plan. Aligned and coordinated the plan with CDC's data modernization initiative (DMI) to help build the foundation for data sharing across all levels of public health. Coordinated policy, governance, and legal issues around the usage of Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA) protected data. Worked with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to adopt CIPSEA guidance and lead NCHS as an early cloud adopter for statistical agencies.
    
  \item \textbf{Piloted} innovative AI, ML, and data science projects to help identity, analyze, and report on emerging public health data. Projects include an item non-response detection model for survey text which resulted in the \href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-science/SANDS-model-context.htm}{first AI model} released by NCHS, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) like homomorphic encryption and privacy preserving record linkage, text-to-speech transcription (which resulted in a 10-fold improvement from prior methods), and the creation of a bibliometrics dashboard for reporting.

      \item \textbf{Built community} by starting and leading three different inclusive organizations within the agency: NCHS Innovation, NCHS Data Science Community of Practice, and the agency-wide EDAV Best Practices group. Organizations helped build community, foster communication, and spur innovative practices across CDC.
