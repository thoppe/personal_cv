{Associate Director of Data Science and Analytics}
{
  \newline CDC / National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
  \newline February 2022 - Present
}
{
  \vspace{-1.50em}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Developed and led three organizations within the agency: NCHS Innovation, NCHS Data Science Community of Practice, and the EDAV Best Practices group to build community, foster communication, and develop innovative practices across CDC.
  \item Developed the first set of model standards for AI/ML within the agency for trustworthy, responsible, and ethical usage. Aligned with existing standards including the NIST AI RMF and HHS Trustworthy AI.
  \item Harmonized metadata usage for all NCHS datasets published on \href{https://data.cdc.gov/browse?category=NCHS}{data.cdc.gov}. Developed and implemented standards for tagging datasets around Social Determinants of Health (SDoH).
  \item Aligned NCHS with the agency data modernization goal of cloud integration. Coordinated policy, governance, and legal issues around the usage of CIPSEA protected data. Lead Tiger Team to identify gaps in existing cloud infrastructure for AI/ML needs.
    \item Piloted many innovative data science projects around the Center including homomorphic encryption, text-to-speech transcription, natural language processing, and bibliometrics.

  \vspace{-1.5em}
  \begin{itemize}

   \item Lead for NCHS Data Modernization Initiative: \emph{Increase Use, Discoverability, and Access to NCHS Data}. Established pilot projects and worked with stakeholders to create statements of work and business needs.
   \item Served on CDC's response to the Executive Order on AI and the NCHS Data Science Strategic Plan. Presented to Board of Scientific Council, NCHS All-Hands, and delivered subject matter talks on Bias in AI, advances in Natural Language Processing, bibliometrics, and more.
   \item Organized Center-wide metadata standards and built a custom ontology using evidence based sources: publications, web searches, and market research.
   \item Developed new methodology to study free text responses from the Research and Development Survey (RANDS), including non-response detection and zero-shot learning objectives.
   \item Implemented PII detection processes for restricted microlevel data.

{
  \vspace{-1.5em}
  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item Scientific team leader for a novel inter-agency government blockchain to detect grant duplication with minimal shared data. Coordinated research, oversaw design, and developed protocols within the NIH and NSF teams.

    \item Developed new analytic tools to process the text of NIH grants and publications using distributional embeddings (word2vec) and transformers (BERT). Tools were deployed for analysis presented to NIH senior leadership, Congress, and publications in high-ranking journals.

    \item Architected and productionized machine learning models for classification, regression, outlier detection, and language modeling. Creator and maintainer of several open-source tools used internationally in the scientific community.

  \item Analyzed grant and publication portfolios, evaluating metrics such as clinical impact, technological impact, and award rates to build quantitative comparisons between various populations.
