Worked with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to adopt CIPSEA guidance and lead NCHS as an early cloud adopter for statistical agencies.
    
        \item Piloted many innovative data science projects to help identity, analyze, and report on emerging public health data. Projects include an item non-response detection model for survey text which resulted in the \href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-science/SANDS-model-context.htm}{first AI model} released by NCHS, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) like homomorphic encryption and privacy preserving record linkage, text-to-speech transcription which resulted in a 10-fold improvement from prior methods, and the creation of a bibliometrics dashboard for reporting.
    
  \item Developed the first set of model standards for AI/ML within the agency for trustworthy, responsible, and ethical usage. Aligned with existing standards including the NIST AI RMF and HHS Trustworthy AI.
    
  \item Developed, started, and led three different organizations within the agency: NCHS Innovation, NCHS Data Science Community of Practice, and the agency-wide EDAV Best Practices group. Organizations helped build community, foster communication, and develop innovative practices across CDC.

  \item Harmonized metadata usage for all NCHS datasets published on \href{https://data.cdc.gov/browse?category=NCHS}{data.cdc.gov}. Developed and implemented standards for tagging datasets around Social Determinants of Health (SDoH).
    
      \item Agency representative for National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) subcommittee on AI/ML and regular presenter at HHS AI and GSA AI communities of practice.
