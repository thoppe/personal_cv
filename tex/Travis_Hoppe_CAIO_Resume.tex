  \item \textbf{Piloted} innovative AI, ML, and data science projects to help identity, analyze, and report on emerging public health data. Projects include an item non-response detection model for survey text which resulted in the \href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-science/SANDS-model-context.htm}{first AI model} released by NCHS, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) like homomorphic encryption and privacy preserving record linkage, text-to-speech transcription which resulted in a 10-fold improvement from prior methods, and the creation of a bibliometrics dashboard for reporting.

      \item \textbf{Developed, started, and led} three different organizations within the agency: NCHS Innovation, NCHS Data Science Community of Practice, and the agency-wide EDAV Best Practices group. Organizations helped build community, foster communication, and develop innovative practices across CDC.
